  - description: Art therapy is an expressive and self-reflective process that involves
      psychodynamic theory and developmental psychology. It uses art and the creative
      process to therapeutically explore and resolve emotional conflicts, develop
      self-awareness and social skills, build problem solving skills, reduce anxiety
      and increase self-esteem. <br/><br/> Art therapy can provide children, adolescents,
      and adults the opportunity for emotional healing and personal growth. <br/>
      <br/> Drawing, painting, sculpting, clay work, crafting, sewing, collage, embroidery,
      and construction are just some of the many creative paths a person can use during
      art therapy.

  - description: CBT is based on the philosophy that individuals tend to incorporate
      faulty thinking, which leads to emotional and behavioural disturbances. Therapy
      primarily focuses on cognitive and behavioural distortions, and stresses the
      role of thinking, deciding, questioning, doing, and re-deciding. CBT utilizes
      interventions that are action oriented and incorporates learning processes which
      include acquiring and practicing new skills and challenging faulty thinking
      patterns.
    name: Cognitive Behavioural Therapy
  - description: The goals of SFT are to change the way clients view their current
      problems, while learning strategies to cope with their present and future circumstances.
      The therapist and client collaboratively establish clear, specific, concrete
      goals to promote/increase positive changes. SFT focuses on externalizing problems
      and looking for exceptions to the problem. SFT utilizes treatment interventions
      that highlight clients’ strengths and improve coping skills.
