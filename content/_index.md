Therapy primarily focuses on cognitive and behavioural distortions, and stresses the role of thinking, deciding, questioning, doing, and re-deciding. CBT utilizes treatment interventions that are action oriented and incorporates learning processes which include acquiring and practicing new skills and challenging faulty thinking patterns."
