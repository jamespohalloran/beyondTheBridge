      - name: Art Therapy
        description: >-
          Art therapy is an expressive and self-reflective process that involves
          psychodynamic theory and developmental psychology. It uses art and the
          creative process to therapeutically explore and resolve emotional
          conflicts, develop self-awareness and social skills, build problem
          solving skills, reduce anxiety and increase self-esteem. <br/><br/>
          Art therapy can provide children, adolescents, and adults the
          opportunity for emotional healing and personal growth. <br/> <br/>
          Drawing, painting, sculpting, clay work, crafting, sewing, collage,
          embroidery, and construction are just some of the many creative paths
          a person can use during art therapy.
      - name: Cognitive Behavioural Therapy
        description: >-
          CBT is based on the philosophy that individuals tend to incorporate
          faulty thinking, which leads to emotional and behavioural
          disturbances. Therapy primarily focuses on cognitive and behavioural
          distortions, and stresses the role of thinking, deciding, questioning,
          doing, and re-deciding. CBT utilizes interventions that are action
          oriented and incorporates learning processes which include acquiring
          and practicing new skills and challenging faulty thinking patterns.
      - name: Solution Focused Therapy
        description: >-
          The goals of SFT are to change the way clients view their current
          problems, while learning strategies to cope with their present and
          future circumstances. The therapist and client collaboratively
          establish clear, specific, concrete goals to promote/increase positive
          changes. SFT focuses on externalizing problems and looking for
          exceptions to the problem. SFT utilizes treatment interventions that
          highlight clients’ strengths and improve coping skills.
